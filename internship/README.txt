data: folder contains raw data--most useful will be "nanoparticle_scattering_data.csv" which is in the "tidy" format already for easy plotting

analysis: folder contains the Jupyter notebook "flow_bkgd_characterization.ipynb" with my analysis of the data, as well as two function libraries: 1) "saxs.py" for analysis methods and 2) "saxsplot.py" for plotting methods
